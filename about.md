Hello and welcome! My name is Ben and I this is my personal website. This website will mainly be used to display my resume, portfolio, and other personal work. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or opportunities you might have for me, as I am always interested in taking on new projects and working with new people.

A little bit about me; I graduated from Michigan State University in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering. I began my professional career working as an analyst at a Fortune 500 company. While I was there I developed a passion for building new tools for my job as well as coding my own projects in my spare time. Upon leaving my position I've had the opportunity to learn and grow as I pursue a new and exciting tech career. I've transitioned into a Ruby on Rails Developer and will be sharing my thoughts and opinions on this blog.
