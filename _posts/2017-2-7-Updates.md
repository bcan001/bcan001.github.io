Hi there, I haven't been on here in awhile and I'll definitely be posting more often. I've just started year 2 of my journey as Web Developer, and it's been quite the experience. Starting this year I want to analyze my code, so I'll be posting examples snippets of stuff I've learned on this blog. Stay tuned!
