title: Work, work, work!

The past few weeks have been pretty busy, both at my regular workplace as well as other side projects I have going on. I really enjoy staying busy, as I tend to get bored pretty easily if I'm not thinking about something or learning something new. I guess I've always felt this way, and I'm glad that I enjoy the work I get to do on a day to day basis. If I didn't enjoy work, I don't know how long I'd last :)
