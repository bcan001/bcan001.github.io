title: New Sites in the works
---

I've decided to work on a few new sites to improve on what I've learned so far. The first one is called 'City-Go', which is going to be my version of the site Do312.com. This is a site that allows users to find music events and festivals in Chicago. I plan on using the SongKick API in conjunction with the Spotify API to bring in information for events and artists.

The second site I'm working on is called 'Stat-Box'. I'm making this a site that displays the scores of sports games, as well as betting lines. I'm not 100% sure what my data source will be for bring in data (through an API, or possibly scraping another site), but I will be doing more research on this and will hopefully be able to find a reliable API for my queries.

I plan on putting in a lot of work on these sites in the next few months, and will have more updates on my progress on these in the near future.
