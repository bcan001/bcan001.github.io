title: Ruby Objects
---

I was reading an article the other day that talked about ruby and how everything constructed in the language is an object. By definition, an object 'is an instance of a class and has state, behavior, and identity'. This definition made me think about my time in programming and, especially in ruby, how everything I make in terms of models and controllers are inheriting state, behavior, and identity from parent classes. This made me realize that I haven't really dived deeper into the code of Rails, which has a lot of inhereted functions from controllers and models simply stated in its API for use. I'm going to start looking into the code of Rails on Github, as I would like to know exactly were all the behavior my controllers and models inherit really comes from.
