title: The Importance of UI
---

At work we've been building a product to mainly be used by our customer service people. While writing the application, it's been really interesting for me to put myself in the shoes of another person and ask myself 'would I use this product?'. So something that I've really taken into account is ease of use, readability and structure. I've introduced breadcrumb navigation to help aid a customer service employee, as well as myself. Sometimes it's easy to get lost in what page you're on, and thing such as a navigation bar really help. I've also thought about implementing a dropdown bar instead of breadcrumbs, which I think will be even easier for a customer service person to use.
