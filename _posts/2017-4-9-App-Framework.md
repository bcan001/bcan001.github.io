title: App Framework and Planning Update
---

For the new project we've decided to use Rails 5 and ReactJS as part of our technical stack. I would like to have more experience using a modern Javascript framework like React, as my work involves mainly just Rails and Foundation. Foundation and Rails gets the job done, but working in React and Angular are the future of web applications, so we've chosen to use React. Right now we're working on wireframing and connecting to API's we'd like to use. We've decided to use the Yelp API and Google Maps API, including its geocoding feature. We'll be hashing out more of the details next week when we meet again and discuss our detailed plan.
